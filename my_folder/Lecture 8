1. 
Both A and B have same productivity score. However, B has more variance than A. 
For A: Lower variance, lower bias
For B: Higher variance, higher bias
Therefore, I will choose A (smaller variance) with higher probability to get productivity score of 75.

2.
For A: mean = 60, lower variance
For B: mean = 80, higher variance

There is a bias-variance tradeoff. 
A is with lower productivity score but lesser bias, B is with higher productivity score but higher bias.
I'll choose B this time because I value productivity more than biase. 
The tradeoff is that if I choose to value more on productivity score, then I have to bear any risks and variability.

3. 

There is no problem with the probablistic forecasting because the test data are within probalistic forecasting distribution.
However, I concern that all my test data are located right from mean. 
This indicate that my forecasting distribution is biased and can't fit my test data very well.
